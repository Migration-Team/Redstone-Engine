# Friday Night Funkin: Redstone Engine

A modification of Friday Night Funkin's engine, designed to tweak little details and add small features to make the game feel a bit more polished.
## Features

- Customizable note hitboxes
- Notes glow when they can be hit
- Decimal BPM support
- Powerful optimization system featuring virtually no noticeable visual changes
- Improved animations
- And more!
